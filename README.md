# Cable-route-optimization-using-MILP
To minimize the cable cost for the coaxial turbine project, a cable routing optimization problem is devised as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) and solved using Gurobipy optimization software.

Run the 'main.py' file to perform the optimization. 'cable_routing_MILP.py' contains the route optimizer and the cable cost model.

The 'plot_route.py' file produces results figures. Examples are shown below.
